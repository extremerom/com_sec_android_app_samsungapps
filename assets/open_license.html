    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as of the date such litigation is filed.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet the following conditions:
    <BR>

    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    <BR>

    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stating that You changed the files; and
    <BR>

    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Derivative Works; and
    <BR>

    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as modifying the License.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conditions stated in this License.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    <BR>

    <BR>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    <BR>
